== Notes ==
= Translation =
Translations are not included, but the theme supports WordPress language packs.

The languages folder inside this theme is redundant, but kept for reference.

= Block Editor and Full Site Editing =
This theme is developed way before the Block Editor and Full Site Editing became part of WordPress.

Theme only has basic support for the block editor. This means that most native blocks look fine in the frontend of your website.

Theme does not support Full Site Editing. And support will not be added in the future.

= Credits =
Without help and support from the WordPress community I was not able to develop this theme, so thank you!

= Support =
If you have a question or problem while using this theme, please visit the relevant theme page at WordPress.org and open a ticket in support forum.
